# HELLO FROM A DIVERGENT MIND
This is a divergent thinking blog. Unlike the blog at: https://blog.igherighe.com, this blog will focus on fun. Well, things I find fun. Like trying to build my own data center, create a programming language from scratch, hacking on raspberry pis, putting code on hardware, AI, and discussions of things I enjoy.

In short, I'll write about whatever I find interesting and hope I'm entertaining enough that someone reads it. Let's see.

# SCHEDULE
Want to know something that's not fun for someone with a divergent brain? Routines. So, I'll post when inspiration hits and the length will...well...depend. Fun = flexible in my world.
